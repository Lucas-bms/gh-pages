                    <h3><strong>About the project</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p2">With a view to the economic development of its territory and its residential attractiveness, the Val de Garonne Agglomeration (VGA) public authority aims to offer alternative modes of transport to the private car. In this context, our work consists of supporting public policies by drawing up prospective scenarios for the development of residential and professional mobility on the scale of the conurbation and neighbouring villages.</p>
                    <h3 class="p1"><strong>Problem</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p2">In this rural area, public transport is less advantageous than the car, especially for commuting, and the needs of users are decentralised throughout the area. In comparison, the car allows greater flexibility and independence in this environment and is the number one choice for getting around. The conurbation finds itself polluted by car use and must therefore rethink mobility for trips between villages, home-to-work journeys and review its public transport system in order to move towards more responsible behaviour.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p class="p2"><strong>How can we think of a sustainable and flexible transport service offer taking into account the rural environment in the Val de Garonne in order to limit the use of the private car?</strong></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <h3 class="p1"><strong>Solution</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p2">Our research phase has shown us the interest in deepening them and the need to engage in a reflection with users. We have identified the need to educate both elected representatives and citizens on mobility issues. This should be done with citizens in order to change their habits and make them responsible in terms of sustainable mobility.</p>
                    <p class="p2">We designed a process of citizen participation, through debate and workshops, to collect, inform and include citizens in the responses for local implementation. This process is based on the creation of a fictitious universe through the use of design fiction, into which the inhabitants and elected representatives of the Val de Garonne will project themselves. It aims to challenge assumptions and imagine the future of mobility.</p>
                    <p>Â </p>
                    <p class="p1"><strong>Design fiction to project yourself into a probable future</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">To believe in fiction, we have used design fiction to involve citizens and elected officials in projecting themselves into a probable future in order to question the present.</p>

                    <p class="p1"><strong>What if... you can no longer drive alone?</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">In order to believe in fiction and to immerse users in fiction, we have designed various devices (website, flyers and video) that take up the codes of the government and the media.</p>
                    <figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/mockup.jpg" alt="" width="2210" height="1244"></figure>
                    <p class="p1"><strong>Projecting, debating and imagining in order to innovate</strong></p>
                    <p class="p1">This frictional narrative is the opening to workshops for debate between citizens. Thus, we propose tools to accompany the workshops to bring the debate to life, bring out issues and accompany public policies. A workshop allows everyone to debate through an imaginary future.</p>

                    <p class="p1">The VGA is a predominantly rural and agricultural area. The needs of the inhabitants are decentralised, so they have to travel long distances to get from point A to point B, which necessarily involves heavy car use. Despite the four fixed transport lines and a transport on demand service for the villages around the city centres and bicycle hire, public transport is little used.</p>

                    <p class="p1">After a meeting with the elected representatives of the Val des Garonne conurbation for the project brief and to set the objectives, our team went to the field to begin with a user research and immersion phase in order to confront a certain experience of the users. We started in Marmande, the most important city of the VGA.</p>
                    <p class="p1">Using a grid of questions, we also interviewed residents of Marmande and the surrounding area: public transport users, bus drivers, local residents and motorists. The aim of these interviews was to identify transport habits, knowledge of public transport and the needs of users. We took public transport in order to see how a journey from the centre of Marmande to the outskirts (factories and dwellings) goes.</p>

                    <p class="p2">On the basis of this study and the observations, we have broken down the main users into several groups: firstly car users and secondly public transport users (workers, high school and college students, and the elderly). We detailed their profiles according to their objectives, expectations, motivations, fears and digital skills. We were able to develop a visualisation of the user experience. Thanks to this, we visualised the needs and objectives of users during their use of a service, noting the negative and positive emotions of these interactions. The important points of the needs and pains of the experience were useful to us in the ideation phase.</p>
                    <p>The verbatims of the users were sorted by subject (car, public transport, bicycle...) and by positive or negative opinion, showing public transport malfunctions, including delays, forgotten passengers or a bus stop missed by the driver.</p>

                    <h3 class="p1"><strong>Understanding the needs of users</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p2">Our analysis and field observation led us to several observations:</p>
                    <ul class="ul1">
                        <li class="li3">a lack of information on available transport;</li>
                        <li class="li3">difficulty in booking and access to stops (adaptability according to the young or senior user);</li>
                        <li class="li3">lack of mobility services - not flexible and not fluid ;</li>
                        <li class="li3">certain types of mobility are not used due to lack of information and fear / prejudice (carpooling);</li>
                        <li class="li3">lack of awareness of tomorrow's mobility, collective and individual interest in using public transport to promote intermodality.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="p2">This analysis identifies essential needs, such as: clear information on existing mobility services, access to fluid and flexible mobility services (for registration and reservation before the bus journey). We note that physical accessibility to transport networks is difficult, especially if the person does not have a bus stop in his or her municipality or if the stop is far away, and if the frequency of timetables is limited. Connections are numerous and intermodality is a brake on smooth travel.</p>
                    <figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/4-besoins.jpg" alt="" width="1303" height="620"></figure>
                    <h3 class="p1"><strong>Targeting users</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p2">As a result of these analyses, we have identified the following types of potential users: residents working fixed hours for residential and business travel. Those who make this type of regular journey are employees, blue-collar workers and schoolchildren.</p>
                    <figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/5-cibles.jpg" alt="" width="1462" height="620"></figure>
                    <h3 class="p1"><strong>Course analysis</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p2">In order to visualise the experience of the users, we have created user itineraries based on data collected in the field. Also, in order to find the root of the problems, we used the 5 whys method to find the problems related to the public transport offers and to find the deep needs.</p>

                    <h5><strong>Journey car</strong></h5>
                    <p class="p1">The car is the most flexible means of transport compared to public transport. However, by analysing the economy of cities, we observe deserted city centres, the main shops are located in commercial areas on the outskirts and that services (work, health) are scattered in the municipalities of the VGA. They are therefore more suitable and accessible by car.</p>

                    <h5 class="p1"><strong>Public transport users</strong></h5>
                    <p class="p1">For commuting or occasional journeys, public transport user routes are less flexible than car travel, as there is less frequency, few stops outside villages, forcing people to take bicycles or walk for example. There is also less intercommunal connection requiring you to go through Marmande if you want to go to other villages. In addition, the fluidity of the route is slowed down by the complexity of registrations and reservations for buses on demand (you have to plan, call to book) and logistical problems cause delays and problems with connections. Finally, there are few mobility services offered in relation to the daily travel needs of the inhabitants, both in terms of public transport, but also in terms of planning: there are few park-and-ride facilities, few or no dedicated cycle routes.</p>
                    <p class="p1">The journey of public transport users is divided into three phases: beforehand in order to prepare for the journey, on the day when the journey takes place and afterwards. The "painful" moments are shown in red on the user route sketches below.</p>

                    <p class="p1">Our first approach is to <strong>think about and promote the shuttle mobility service offer </strong>(from relay villages to multimodal exchange hubs). This hypothesis responds directly to the problems of information and communication around public transport, particularly on websites.</p>

                    <p class="p1">The second track explores the creation of a new mobility economy. To this end, we have devised a collaborative transport service based on car-sharing, for free and rewarding communal and inter-communal transport in the Val de Garonne Agglomeration, with meeting points set aside for this purpose.</p>
                    <p class="p1">The car-sharing service would operate free of charge by paying users in local currency created for this purpose. The currency could then be used in certain VGA shops and services. However, the driver would not be remunerated on the costs of using his journey, making the daily journey we propose to provide a rewarding benefit. In addition, this new service offer provides an intermediary to the private car to facilitate inter-municipal transport and interconnection with shuttle mobility services (PEM - relay towns). We have presented this hypothesis in the form of usage scenarios.</p>

                    <p class="p1">The VGA team has chosen to set off on track three and explore a future through design fiction. We designed our proposal in two stages:</p>
                    <ol class="ol1">
                        <li class="li2"><strong>the conception of design fiction at first, </strong>which introduces to an imaginary world through immersion objects ;</li>
                        <li class="li2">it allows the introduction to <strong>participative workshops </strong>to debate on mobility and imagine a better present with the inhabitants, elected representatives and stakeholders.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 class="p1"><strong>What is design fiction?</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p2"><strong>What? </strong>Design fiction is a branch of design that creates <strong>projects </strong>made to anticipate plausible, probable, desirable, preferable futures... We imagine the future through fiction in order to re-interrogate the present through projection, "what <strong>if.</strong>.. it was like this... what would happen? " through a <strong>narrative</strong>.</p>
                    <p class="p2"><strong>Why? </strong>Design fiction probes our beliefs and values, challenges our assumptions and encourages us to imagine how what we call 'reality' might be different. Projection allows us to create debates around today's issues in order to make better decisions.</p>
                    <p class="p2"><strong>How? </strong>It is about creating a context, a fictional story around a narrative in which our users/audience can project themselves with the help of a tangible universe and an object that creates a world. It is in the projection into this fictional world that we can debate using the elements of this world as a support.</p>

                    <p class="align-center"><span style="color: #fc9561;"><strong>What if you can no longer drive alone?</strong></span></p>
                    <p class="p1">Our fictional world imagines mobility with the ideal means of transport for the inhabitants of the VGA: the car. To make this viable, a law requires carpooling at certain times of the day to raise awareness of the car for several people. Based on the air-label sticker, a sticker must be affixed to the windscreen to show how many people must be in the car at certain times. Depending on the car, you should drive with one, two or three passengers in your car.</p>
                    <p class="p1">We choose to talk about the private car because there is a strong dependence of the inhabitants for this type of transport. We have imagined a possible, probable future, but it may not be preferable or even perfect, but it allows us to be the basis for reflection.</p>

The architecture of the information is worked according to the social network format and this communication reaches a wide audience. It allows us to target young, educated citizens who use other media to keep up to date with current events. They are not the only ones targeted, but they are part of our target audience of fixed time travel.</p>

                    <p class="p2">Design fiction proposes a story that questions our daily lives and our needs in the first part to debate a possible future. It is thanks to these reactions that we can then find the stakes, the precise issues and create around the workshop.</p>

                    <p class="p1">We have designed the workshops and the tools to work on them: a tool for finding the root of the problem, sharing experience, decision-making... The workshop is divided into different phases:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="li1"><strong>Phase 1: </strong>Identifying themes</li>
                        <li class="li1"><strong>Phase 2: </strong>Finding the problem</li>
                        <li class="li1"><strong>Phase 3: </strong>Visualising the problemÂ </li>
                        <li class="li1"><strong>Phase 4: </strong>Pitching, restoring the problems</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="p1">Subsequently, the workshops could be broken down into different phases, going as far as imagining and prototyping concrete solutions. With the workshops, we create a space and time to have feedback from citizens and informed discussions with elected officials in order to lead to other types of solutions. They will allow elected officials to take into consideration needs and make appropriate choices.</p>

                    <h3 class="p1"><strong>The gains</strong></h3>
                    <p class="p1">Design fiction enables the <strong>foundations to be laid for a real problem, to explore in depth the possibilities for action, </strong>to raise awareness of mobility and to engage in a process of empathy with the community. As noted, citizens have a strong need for mobility by car. It is necessary to raise awareness of practices to invest in new uses of mobility, whether by reviewing the use of the shuttle and public transport (lane 1) or with free carpooling (lane 2).</p>
                    <p>Â </p>
                    <h2 class="align-center"><strong><span style="color: #fc9561;">Conclusion</span></strong></h2>
                    <p>Â </p>
                    <p class="p1">Field observation has enabled us to bring out existing problems in terms of mobility, which design fiction allows us 
                        to re-interview through the narrative. Even if it seems redundant, it seemed essential to us to be able to start again on a phase 
                        of exploration and ideation in cooperation and to question the issues and objectives with all the stakeholders. This iteration then 
                        allows us to offer a service that takes into account deeper systemic issues. But the workshop could not take place.</p>
                        <p class="p1">Digital technology can revolutionise mobility practices, but scaling up from cities to countryside works with different complexities.
                         I think that design makes it possible, through modelling and visualisation, to accompany this kind of problem and to implement strong 
                         solutions. Finally, this project has reinforced my idea of the importance of finding the WHY of the problem and the how afterwards, hence our interest in design fiction. Finally, the user journey map is a tool that I find extremely useful, allowing me to find the problems and also a support for cooperation with stakeholders.</p>
