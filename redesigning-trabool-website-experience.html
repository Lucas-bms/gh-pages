It is set up by the metropolis of Lyon with public and private partners. The Trabool site is used by users to order and recharge their cards and subscriptions from home, using a charger included in the kit.<p>As this service was deployed when I arrived in the Metropolis, I followed it for 12 months through several missions in parallel (graphics, user testing of the application, etc). I present one of the projects here.<h3><strong>Problem</strong></h3><p class=p1>As Trabool has evolved, new technical features have been added to the website to improve it: adding accounts, managing multiple accounts and subscriptions, ordering or renewing a card and many more. But some of these aspects blocked the user's journey through the site by the information architecture and layout. Led by the project manager, our team worked on redesigning the website and user journeys in order to integrate changes.<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3><p class=p1>After several iterations and user tests, we have designed new interfaces for the registration process, the subscription and the management of personal information.<p class=p1><strong>With Trabool, have only one card for your travels</strong><p class=p1>One place to order, subscribe to services and manage subscriptions for you and your loved ones.<h5><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img alt=""height=600 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/accueil.png width=450></figure></h5><p><p class=p1><strong>Simple management shared with your family and friends</strong><p class=p1>Simply add all the members of your family.

My role in this project was that of service designer and ux, in a team composed of two project managers, a social psychologist and a UX designer, in collaboration with the team in charge of the website development (Sopra Steria) and a business analyst. Working as a team with Valentin and Alexandra, we decided together on the approach to be followed, alternating phases of work in co-design and alone.<p><h2 class=align-center><span style=color:#fc9561><strong>1. Research</strong></span></h2><p><h3>State of play</h3><p class=p1>The project benefits from an experimentation phase led by Valentin Labit, a social psychologist, that is voluntary users known as "pioneers" test services before they are set up for the general public. They answer questionnaires and are mobilised for workshops. His expertise throughout the project and the information he has been collecting for several months has enabled us to understand the behaviour and emotions of users, identify problems and define their needs.<h3>Defining the target</h3><p class=p1>Trabool is a public service and is open to all inhabitants of the metropolis. The public of the Trabool service is all inhabitants from the age of 18. Currently, users are men and women between 40 and 60 years old, family and executive users who need to combine subscriptions and manage those of their relatives. Some services are still accessible to a particular target group.<figure class=post__image><img alt=prÃ©sentation-test height=3120 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/test-utilisateur.jpg width=4160><figcaption>Test session with technical experts for the future mobile application.</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Understanding the difficulties</strong></h3><p class=p1>As a result of its workshops and questionnaires, we were able to analyse that there were problems of understanding of the Trabool service on the part of the users as well as problems for :<ul><li class=li1>ordering a card, viewing and navigating the available offers;<li class=li1>renewing a lost card;<li class=li1>transferring a partner subscription.</ul><p class=p1>Many of the problems were due to the layout of the information, the prioritization of the information which caused a lack of clarity in the service and the use of the website.<div class=gallery-wrapper><div class=gallery data-columns=2 data-is-empty=false><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-commande-2.png data-size=700x1242><img alt=""height=1242 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-commande-2-thumbnail.png width=700></a><figcaption>Responsive problem</figcaption></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.51.33.png data-size=694x1193><img alt=""height=1193 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.51.33-thumbnail.png width=694></a><figcaption>Responsive problem</figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=gallery-wrapper><div class=gallery data-columns=2 data-is-empty=false><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.53.41.png data-size=1326x942><img alt=""height=546 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.53.41-thumbnail.png width=768></a><figcaption>Error message not visible.</figcaption></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-2.png data-size=1361x618><img alt=""height=349 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-2-thumbnail.png width=768></a><figcaption>Error message arrives at the end of the order process.</figcaption></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/abonnement-probleme-2.png data-size=2547x1427><img alt=""height=430 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/abonnement-probleme-2-thumbnail.png width=768></a><figcaption>Subscription information not visible.</figcaption></figure></div></div><h3><strong>Define design goals</strong></h3><p class=p1>During brainstorming, our team determined the main objectives of the roadmap according to the future stages of the project. We came to dedicate ourselves to facilitating the ordering of a card, the management of subscriptions, personal information and the overall organisation of the site.<p class=p1>For this mission, my resource was:<ul><li class=li1>propose new, clearer and more intuitive user journeys;<li class=li1>reorganise the existing functionalities;<li class=li1>complete the graphic charter.</ul><p class=p1>But in addition to the website, we worked on clarifying the value proposition of Trabool. I believe that a clear and strong service proposition is more likely to create engaging services. This would increase the subscription to services for recurring use. Most users use the service to renew their subscriptions, but do not subscribe to additional services.<p class=p1>We have also established a business model canvas of the current status of the project, identifying the value propositions and targets of the project. You can find this project in the following Sprint Design page.<p><h2 class=align-center><span style=color:#fc9561><strong>2. Redesign process</strong></span></h2><p><h3>Inspiration</h3><p class=p1>Examining application dashboards that allow the management of several accounts at the same time, we were able to draw out the key points of their success:<ul class=ul1><li class=li2>structured navigation identification of information relating to each account<li class=li2>presentation of offers and action button</ul><h3 class=p1><strong>Building the page structure</strong></h3><p class=p2>Thanks to our observations and the analysis of technical bugs provided by the business analyst, we were able to start imagining user journey solutions. Our ideation phase started with quick interface sketches. Sketch sessions allow us to quickly project ideas once problems were identified and iterated quickly. We then modified the user journeys and made wireframes for initial results. We tried to represent a new information architecture of the pages.<p><strong>Order a Trabool card</strong><p class=p1>A more direct way to create an account or to connect via Grand Lyon Connect (the Metropolis' authentication platform) to order your card.<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img alt=""height=533 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/1_sketch-commander-3.jpg width=400><figcaption>Sketch of the registration route. Session of 1h 45 sketch.</figcaption></figure><p class=p1><p class=p1><strong>Manage your account</strong><p>Offers are managed on a single interface, with information relating to each subscription and the possibility of renewing them. It gives access to the different subscriptions of his "Tribe"Â  composed of his relatives. The term "Tribe" (Tribu in french) made us wonder if users understood it. It was used before, but after the tests we came back to a simpler term. We had imagined the change of account in order to manage the information of each account, but this added steps in the journey which was not used at the moment.<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img alt=""height=533 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/2_sketch-gerer.jpg width=400><figcaption>Search Sketch for account management.</figcaption></figure><p><p class=p1><strong>The offers</strong><p class=p1>We have worked on a simplified visualization of the offers. In this version, we wanted users to be able to see the offers by type and novelties.<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img alt=""height=533 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/3_sketch-offre.jpg width=400><figcaption>Research sketch for the visualization of offers.</figcaption></figure><p><h3 class=p1><strong>Wireframes</strong></h3><p class=p2>The VÃ©lÃ©da board representation quickly brought us solutions for the presentation and management of several accounts. I quickly built a few basic screens to get feedback from the team and users on the structure and organization of the pages, which led to the establishment of a hierarchical visualization and standard layout for future components of the site.<div class=gallery-wrapper><div class=gallery data-columns=2 data-is-empty=false><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Accueil.jpg data-size=4001x3992><img alt=wireframe-accueil height=766 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Accueil-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a><figcaption>Wireframe of the home page</figcaption></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Decouvrir_les_services.jpg data-size=4001x6259><img alt=wireframe-offre height=1201 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Decouvrir_les_services-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a><figcaption>Structure of the offers</figcaption></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Commander_un_pass_etape1.jpg data-size=4001x2601><img alt=wireframe-commande height=499 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Commander_un_pass_etape1-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a><figcaption>Wireframe of the card order</figcaption></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/4-Wireframes_Commander_un_pass-_choix.jpg data-size=4001x2253><img alt=""height=432 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/4-Wireframes_Commander_un_pass-_choix-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a><figcaption>Wireframe when ordering</figcaption></figure></div></div><p class=p1>The current use of the site is geared towards computer users, because to renew subscriptions you have to connect your card to a box once ordered. But to improve usage on smartphones, the most penalising moment is the synchronisation phase between the card and the computer.<h3 class=p1><strong>User flow</strong></h3><p class=p2>We noticed that the connection phase could be problematic, as it required the change of site and then reconnection to Trabool. Integrating it would make the route more fluid during connection and registration, but the technique used did not allow this to be done. The use of paper and manual interaction allows a first approach to the user experience.<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img alt=architecture-information height=459 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/architecture-information.png width=700><figcaption>User flow.</figcaption></figure><h3 class=p1><strong>Interfaces high-fidelity</strong></h3><p class=p1>Once the wireframe screens had been finalised without colour, we were able to move on to the test phase.<div class=gallery-wrapper><div class=gallery data-columns=2 data-is-empty=false><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/accueil.jpg data-size=1920x2199><img alt=""height=880 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/accueil-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/les-offres.jpg data-size=1920x2348><img alt=""height=939 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/les-offres-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/ma-tribu.jpg data-size=1920x1339><img alt=""height=536 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/ma-tribu-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a></figure><figure class=gallery__item><a href=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Commander-un-pass.jpg data-size=1920x1400><img alt=""height=560 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Commander-un-pass-thumbnail.jpg width=768></a></figure></div></div><p><h2 class=align-center><span style=color:#fc9561><strong>3. Evaluation</strong></span></h2><p><h3 class=p1><strong>Prepare user tests</strong></h3><p class=p1>Testing is the best way to evaluate the user experience. We have conducted usability tests with users to validate new designs that address problems. Testing on a loyalty-based interface will also allow us to understand how users navigate, interact with the site and perceive the service. Several volunteer testers were chosen for the tests, which took place in an individual room, via a laptop with video and audio recording.<h3 class=p2><strong>Protocol & objectives</strong></h3><p class=p1>The objectives were to validate the user experience and our design assumptions before going into production by evaluating the overall system, ergonomics, usability and general understanding of the Trabool service. To do this, I designed a test protocol based on usage scenarios to measure the tasks performed for the routes and functionalities using an observation grid. The scenarios are used to validate or not functionalities and user journey such as:<ul class=ul1><li class=li3>The creation of Grand Lyon Connect and Trabool accounts;<li class=li3>The order of a card for yourself, for my family;<li class=li3>Subscribing to an offer;<li class=li3>Management of the offers subscribed in my subscriptions;<li class=li3>Understanding of <span class=s1>"</span>Tribe" and service in general.</ul><h3 class=p2>Perform the tests</h3><p class=p1>During the test, we observe and take notes on how the testers interact with the site, how it navigates, what they say.<figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img alt=""height=363 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/user-test-2.jpg width=360></figure><p class=p1>The tests are followed by an interview and end with the SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaire measuring usability and site experience in order to identify the value of our website.<p class="msg msg--highlight">"Usability is aÂ <strong>quality attribute</strong> that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use." source : nngroup.com<h3 class=p1><strong>Understanding the Trabool service</strong></h3><p class=p2>During the first tests, the testers had difficulties understanding the Trabool service and its ecosystem: a website to subscribe and a card used and how it works. Others did not know where to look for information about Trabool and the project leaders. Descriptions are not understandable and long presentation texts are rarely read. For the presentation of offers, explanations are missing and the reading is not visible, which can result in a negative experience because it is not understandable.<h3 class=p1><strong>Order a Trabool card</strong></h3><p class=p2>When ordering a card, the subscription transfer is not included, as users are wondering if there will be redundancy in the transportation cards. We have also noticed a misunderstanding of the wording when ordering the Trabool card such as "Tribe" or "Activate transport function". Once the card has been received, it allows you to subscribe to public transport. During the tests, 1 out of 4 users did not activate it. Finally, when a new user creates an account, the switching to the Grand Lyon Connect connection site is not understood, and raises the issue of the overall consistency of Metropolitan services.<h3 class=p1><strong>User feedback</strong></h3><p class=p2>The tests allowed us to build on the negative points of the site's course in order to improve them and to make hypotheses on the next steps of the design. Certain aspects that we did not fear, such as when ordering a card, were not understood on the whole and allowed us to take a step back to improve the interfaces. The simplest elements are the management and ordering of offers. But overall, the value of the service provided for users is not very clear and does not seem to meet their expectations.<p><h2 class=align-center><span style=color:#fc9561><strong>4. Final Design</strong></span></h2><p><h3 class=p1><strong>High-fidelity integration</strong></h3><p class=p1>After a phase of iterations on the high-fidelity interfaces, we designed a final version of the interfaces. The final version of the interfaces was re-tested in order to validate our final interfaces. We had to limit our ideas to the technical possibilities and the demand. In one version, I would have liked to integrate a map of cultural and sports venues in combination with mobility possibilities and open routes. The improvements reorganize the pages, making the user journey more fluid and integrating the management of several accounts. We have integrated a sorting by type of domain of the offers and a section dedicated to the new services for a simple display, a graphic coherence to keep, an account and subscription management and the responsive.<figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img alt=""height=1576 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/background-ordi-2.jpg width=3050></figure><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img alt=""height=2044 loading=lazy src=https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/background-smartphone.jpg width=3620></figure><h3 class=p1><strong>Sharing of advances</strong></h3><p class=p1>We designed the high-fidelity mock-up on Figma so that all team members as well as front-end developers can access it and allow them to inspect the file and export the CSS components. The development was followed up with the business analyst, and via a ticket tracking table to ensure that the implementation was aligned with the interfaces we designed.<p><h2 class=align-center><span style=color:#fc9561>Conclusion</span></h2><p><p>Overall in the final version, users find themselves in the paths, the creation of the account and the addition and management of several accounts makes the understanding of the service as a whole and for new users clearer. This redesign of the interfaces and user experience allowed us to start the new evolutions present on the roadmap, by adding a ticketing system. This would add an accentuated use of the map and the application to come.
